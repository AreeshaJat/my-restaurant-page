# restaurant-page

## Project Description
This is a restuarant page application where the user is able to see the home page which has a welcome message, a menu page which has a list of menus and an about page which allows you to input your information and upon submit navigates you back to the home page. 

## Features and Functionality
The restuarant page mimics a fake mexican restuarant page called "El Alma del Sabor" which means the soul of flavour and it consists of 6 mexican dishes with their description and ingredients. Along with that there is also a contact page which is loaded when the about button is clicked. This application was mainly created by dynamically appending div's and classes under the content id. In this project I mainly learned about webpack and was able to get myself comfortable with the features in webpack. In addition to this, I also learned about making more modular javascript code by having modules which makes the code more organized and easy to manage.
